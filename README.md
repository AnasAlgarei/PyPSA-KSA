# PyPSA-KSA
This is an initial work to build current and prospected power network models of the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.

The model presented here is for 2030 scenario with 50% renewable share, this model is made using [PyPSA-Earth](https://github.com/pypsa-meets-earth/pypsa-earth).

This work is part of a [masters thesis](https://zenodo.org/records/7017741) and can be expanded to include several scenarios with better data.

## To Do
- Aquire more accurate data to build the model on
- Build different scenarios to represent current and possible future scenarios
- Predict load based on the development in Saudi Arabia
- Include different energy sectors
